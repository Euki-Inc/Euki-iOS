**Overview**

Euki App is the privacy first period tracker. 
Designed in collaboration with our users, Euki is made for any body and every body.


**Contributing Guidelines**

We are a small, nonprofit team managing a new open source project.

Our first priority in releasing Euki open source is to increase transparency. 

At the moment we don't have the capacity to accept code contributions. Over time, we hope this project will become more collaborative and we will be able to review, vet, and accept some code contributions from the community. 


**About the App**

Euki App combines 2 key resources:
1. A period-tracking tool
2. A sex education library with inclusive and evidence-based resources on topics like abortion, contraception, and sexuality.

All while being:

Free!

Easy to use.

Plus, it has best in class features like data deletion, offline-friendly functionality, and PIN protection.
